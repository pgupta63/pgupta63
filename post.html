                        <p>The purpose of this map was to describe the spatial distribution of the Hispanic population in the contiguous U.S. by state, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. The preface of this map involved familiarizing oneself with maps such as area class, proportional symbol, dot density, and choropleth, which was the best fit for this problem. Developing the skills of making a choropleth map, the data was taken from the US Census Bureau and organized by attribute. The final map tells a comprehensive story of the states in the US where Hispanics are most populous. </p>
                        <p>The skills learned in this project involved understanding how Census data is collected and mapped. Another skill is applying the select by attribute function to select for specific characteristics, and using the symbology tool to manipulate the visual characteristics of the map. The layers were added onto ArcGIS Pro, and sorted by attribute to focus on the contiguous US. The data was then sorted in ascending order to yield the states with the highest populations of Hispanics, and then relayed onto a choropleth map.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this map was to apply several data manipulation skills to present the spatial distribution of density of homicides in Chicago by police district. This data was presented as a choropleth map in the appropriate UTM coordinate system, and also included a legend, scale bar, and north arrow. In order to organize the data for this problem, it was important to apply a variety of skills such as map joining, quantifying, summarizing, and many more. The final result is a map that relays technical information about homicide densities in Chicago, as well as an informative map that can be used for better city safety planning, funding, etc. </p>
                        <p>This map applies the skills of quantifying and summarizing data sets, as well as joining data for better organization and to relate the different data sets. Another skill acquired was the use of joined data and a the field calculator to apply and calculate the data appropriately to find various densities. The shapefiles were added onto ArcGIS Pro, where the Selected_Crimes and Police_Districts were summarized and joined to give the districts with homicide cases. A field for area was added to the Police_Districts file, and then the calculate tool was used to find the density of the homicide cases by district. </p>

                        <p>This map is a comprehensive display of more complex operations such as buffers, dissolves, and overlays. This problem looks at a scenario in which the Philadelphia city government can find a location to build a farmer's market. The potential location for the farmer's market should be within a Philadelphia empowerment zone, within 2000ft of a subway or regional rail station, not within 1200ft of a farmers market or corner store participating in the Healthy Corner Store Initiative, and  larger contiguous area is preferable to increase the likelihood of securing a potential property. Employing various techniques, a final map was made in which the target areas were found with the given criteria.</p>
                        <p>The skills learned were using the buffer tool to analyze data within a specified distance. Another skill learned was using the union tool to analyze data within a specified distance. Another skill learned was using the union tool to could be used to erase one unionized data set from another, to further allow inclusive and exclusive data to overlap. The data was added onto ArcGIS Pro, buffered, then unioned.  Then the data which was excluded (farmers markets and corner stores), were buffered and unioned to yield the areas which fit the parameters, but were to be excluded from the final data set. The erase tool was used to erase the exclusive areas from the inclusive ones, and the areas that yielded were operated on with the multipart to singlepart tool, which yielded the final areas in which the new store could be located with the given parameters.</p>
